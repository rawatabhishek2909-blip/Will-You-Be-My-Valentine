# 💖 Will You Be My Valentine?

A fun and interactive Valentine’s Day website built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The page playfully asks the big question — and the “No” button isn’t very cooperative 😄❤️

Live demo includes animated hearts, changing questions on every “No” click, and a sweet ending when “Yes” is clicked.
